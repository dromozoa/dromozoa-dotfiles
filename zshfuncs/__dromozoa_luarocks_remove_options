Four modes are supported: * all - use all trees from the rocks_trees list for finding dependencies * one - use only the current tree (possibly set with --tree) * order - use trees based on order (use the current tree and all trees below it on the rocks_trees list) * none - ignore dependencies altogether. The default mode may be set with the deps_mode entry in the configuration file. The current default is "one". Type '\''luarocks'\'' with no arguments to see your list of rocks trees.]:mode'
